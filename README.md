Retail Sales Performance Analysis

Goal:
To analyze the global retail sales history, identify trends, and provide actionable insights on regional performance, sales channels, and product categories. The aim is to uncover patterns that can drive improvements in sales strategies.

Description:
The dataset consists of global retail sales records from January 2010 to January 2020. The records include various sales data, such as order IDs, order and shipping dates, prices, quantities, geographic regions, sales channels (online vs. offline), and product categories. The project will involve the following steps: data loading, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), regional performance comparison, sales channel effectiveness analysis, seasonal pattern identification, and time-series forecasting.

Steps include:

Data Loading & Preprocessing:
Load the dataset and perform data cleaning (handling missing values, ensuring correct data types, and preparing it for analysis).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Examine overall sales trends over time, regional performance comparisons, and sales by product category. Analyze the split between online and offline sales channels.
Regional Performance Comparison:
Compare the performance of different regions (Australia/Oceania, Middle East/North Africa, USA, and Greenland) to understand which areas contribute the most to sales.
Sales Channel Analysis:
Evaluate the effectiveness of online and offline sales channels, identifying trends and potential areas for improvement.
Seasonal and Time-Series Analysis:
Identify seasonal patterns and forecast future sales based on historical data to optimize inventory and sales strategies.
Hypothesis Testing:
Test hypotheses such as whether product category type or order priority significantly impacts sales performance.
Skills:

Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Data visualization
Time-series forecasting
Hypothesis testing
Sales trend analysis
Technology:

Python (Pandas, NumPy)
Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization
Statsmodels / Facebook Prophet for time-series forecasting
Jupyter Notebook for code execution and documentation
Results:
The analysis will produce Python functions and visualizations that:

Display sales trends over time, broken down by region and sales channel.
Compare regional sales performance and identify key contributors to total sales.
Analyze product category performance, highlighting the most popular categories.
Present seasonal patterns and forecast future sales trends using time-series models.
Test and validate hypotheses related to sales drivers (e.g., order priority, sales channels).
Insights will help in making data-driven decisions to enhance sales strategies, improve regional performance, and optimize sales channels.
